# Open Payments Network

The Open Payments Network is a network of third-party providers (TPPs) or clients that access [Interledger](https://interledger.org)-enabled accounts via the [Open Payments APIs](https://openpayments.guide).

The purpose of the Open Payments Network is to establish a network of trusted clients to assist account providers (wallets) in ensuring the security of their customer's accounts when implementing Open Payments.

The primary function of this repo is to host the design and code behind the website at https://openpayments.network which is where the directory of registered clients (TPPs) is hosted.
